# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection-using-Logistic_Regression
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Logistic Regression model ‚Äî a simple yet effective supervised machine learning algorithm. Fraud detection is a crucial real-world problem, as it helps financial institutions minimize monetary losses and protect customers from unauthorized transactions.
‚úÖ Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and balancing imbalanced data using techniques like undersampling or SMOTE.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing transaction patterns, class imbalance, correlations, and outliers.

Model Building: Training a Logistic Regression model to classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.

Prediction: Predicting fraud on new/unseen transactions to test model generalization.

üìä Dataset
This project typically uses an open-source credit card transactions dataset, which includes:

Transaction amount

Transaction time

Anonymized input features (due to confidentiality)

A binary fraud label (0 = genuine, 1 = fraud)

A popular dataset is the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset: Link to dataset

üöÄ Goal
The goal is to build a simple, interpretable fraud detection pipeline that can:

Identify fraudulent transactions with high recall (catching most frauds)

Minimize false positives

Serve as a baseline for comparing with more advanced models

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
